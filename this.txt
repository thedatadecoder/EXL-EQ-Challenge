1.First, I predicted the "Store_Name" for "Pinginformation" dataframe by:-
(a) I trained the Randomforest classifier by taking features as "Floor", "longitude"
    and "latitude" and labels as "Store_Name" from storemapping dataframe.
(b) Predicted the "Store_Name" as labels on pinginformation dataframe by taking "Floor", 
    "longitude" and "latitude" as testing features from pinginformation dataframe for every
    corresponding "Shopper_ID".
(c) Took the most frequent occuring value (Mode) of "Store_Name" for every corresponding
    "Shopper_ID".
2.Second, I predicted the "Store_Category_Visited" for "Pinginformation" dataframe by:-
(a) I mapped the "Store_Category_Name" for storemapping dataframe by using Categorymapping
    dataframe for corresponding "Store_Name".
(b) Trained the Support Vector Machine classifier by taking features as "Floor", "longitude"
    and "latitude" and labels as "Store_Category" from storemapping dataframe.
(c) Predicted the "Store_Category" as labels on pinginformation dataframe by taking "Floor", 
    "longitude" and "latitude" as testing features from pinginformation dataframe for every
    corresponding "Shopper_ID".
(d) Took the most frequent occuring value (Mode) of "Store_Category" for every corresponding
    "Shopper_ID".
